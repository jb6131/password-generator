# Password Generator

## Description

This web application was created to facilitate password generation for the user. The generator uses JavaScript to prompt the user for specific criteria for the desired password, including length and whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. The generated password is then displayed in the center textbox.

## Usage

Clicking on the red "Generate Password" button will prompt the user for a desired length for the password. Once the user has entered a valid number between 8 and 128, the user is then asked if they would like to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, or special characters. The user is required to select at least one character type in order to finally generate the password.
